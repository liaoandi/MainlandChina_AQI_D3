1) How to let a svg start at a new place(e.g. under the map)? 
Now I couldn't get it working, so I keep only the map.js to display in GitHub Pages. And my date slider is not in the ideal place.

2) Should I write all the js code in one file or seperate them into different files?

3) How to read in multiple files elegantly?

4) The update function in map.js doesn't update the values, although the loop is running. It seems that enter-update-exit part is 
not executing. But I couldn't figure out why.

5) How to remeber all records in one district in one year in loop, and average them as the assigned value for geojson.properties.value?
